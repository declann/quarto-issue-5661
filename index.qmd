```{ojs}
umd = require('./resources/umd.js')

umd
```

Note resources config.

In `preview` mode a refresh event should be sent when `./resources/umd.js` is modified, but this doesn't work.

Rename the file e.g. to `umd_.js` does result in a refresh even so does renaming it back.

Actually, I notice that creating a new file in the resources folder also results in a refresh event, so perhaps resources folders and not specific files are being watched. There still seems to be a regression RE picking up file changes.

I can require `umd.js` without putting it in a resources folder/config, however that results in no refresh events when I update/delete/rename it.
